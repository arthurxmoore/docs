# Troubleshooting

### I've run into a bug. Where can I find the log files?

You can access the log files via the **Help** menu item in the main `Jumper.app` on macOS.

### Jumper's not working as expected

The first thing to do is try restarting the **Jumper Engine** via the main `Jumper.app` on macOS.

If you're using Final Cut Pro, you can also try restarting the **Final Cut Pro Automation Engine**.

### Jumper seems slow

Jumper will have a faster time loading media that is has already processed.

If you are experiencing slow loading times of the media table in Jumper, try creating a new Premiere project or Final Cut Pro Library where you only add a subset of media files. Process those and verify that you can search in them.

If all looks good, import another batch of media files and process those, etc.

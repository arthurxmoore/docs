### How do I get access to the beta?

Go to the [Jumper Beta sign up form](https://forms.gle/Rk6ZezAaVzKPanH46) and make a request and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

We are currently beta testing support in both Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere.

### I’ve signed up but still haven’t gotten a download link or license key?

We’re sending out beta access at a sustainable pace.

We want to be able to assist and support without being overwhelmed.

Please have patience and you should get your access soon.

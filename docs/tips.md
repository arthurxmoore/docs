# Tips & Tricks

Here are a few tips and tricks to get the best out of Jumper...

- Don't use negative search terms (i.e. "no blue shirts").
- Add the **time of day** to your search string to narrow down your search results. For example, "during daytime" or "during nighttime".
- You can use the Speech search to find key phrases like "Action" or "Scene 5, Take 3".
- Writing clothes colours and/or type can be very helpful.
- If "a couple kissing on bench" doesn't work, try "a couple sitting on bench" - i.e. simplify the search.
- If you are looking for something in your footage that you have a picture of, drop that picture in to the timeline and press "Match Program Monitor" in Premiere, or "Match Viewer" in Final Cut Pro.
- Find similar can be sometimes more helpful then text search.
- If you can't find the thing you want with text, try press "Find Similar" on things that look like what you are looking for.

# Uninstall

## macOS

Just drag the `Jumper.app` from your Applications folder to the Bin/Trash.

Jumper stores additional files in the following places:

- `~/.jumper`
- `~/Library/Logs/Jumper`
- `~/Library/Containers/com.jumper.WorkflowExtension`
- `~/Library/Containers/com.jumper`
- `~/Library/Application Support/jumper-cache`

You can manually remove these folders or use something like [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

---

## Windows

Delete the Jumper folder located in `C:\Users\YOUR-USER-NAME\AppData\Roaming\Jumper\`

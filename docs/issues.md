- **[JMPR-264]** Jumper currently doesn't work on macOS Sequoia 15.0 or 15.1 beta's. We are actively exploring this.
- **[JMPR-175]** Jumper doesn't like video files that don't contain any audio tracks. This will be fixed in a future beta. Thanks for reporting Sam Pluemacher!
- **[JMPR-179]** Add support for Multicam & Synchronised Clips via FCPXML. Thanks for providing feedback Matthieu Laclau!
- **[JMPR-183]** Add support for Multicam & Merge Clips to Premiere.
- **[JMPR-171]** Add support for Multiple Libraries in Final Cut Pro. Currently we'll just select the first Event with the name - so if you have two libraries with the same name, this won't work. Thanks for suggesting Iain Anderson!
- **[JMPR-186]** Jumper should process audio from every channel. Currently it only processes audio from the first channel that has valid dialogue. Thanks for suggesting D.L. Watson!
